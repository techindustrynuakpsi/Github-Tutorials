You should already know how to: clone a repository on Github. 
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a branch, change branches, edit text files, and commit changes.

1. Open your terminal. Cd into this Github-Tutorials directory. 

2. Check to make sure your branch has no unsaved changes by typing 'git status'. You should get a message that says your branch is up to date. 

3. Check the status of the repository by typing the command: 'git pull'. This will check to see if any files have been added to the repository and add them to your repository. It also will add any changes people have made to the files.

4. Make a branch by typing 'git branch name_of_branch'. 'name_of_branch' can typically be anything, but for this test, we want it to be your Github username to ensure that two people don't try to commit the same branch name.
